# What is Jeka

<strong>Jeka</strong>(formerly Jerkar) is a complete **Java build system** ala _Ant_, _Maven_, _Gradle_ or _Buildr_ using **pure Java** to automate your tasks. No XML or scripts : only rock solid Java code.

Enjoy all the engineering power you are comfortable with (Java code, IDE, 3rd party libs,  Maven repository, ...) to define, 
design, run, debug, reuse your automated tasks/builds. Exactly as you would do with regular code.

Also, __Jeka conventions and plugin mechanism are so powerful__ that it can perform pretty exotic tasks without needing a single line of code/configuration. 

For example `jerkar java#pack jacoco# sonar#run -sonar#host.url=http://myserver/sonar`
performs a complete build running unit tests under Jacoco coverage tools and performs Sonar analysis on a Java project free 
of any build-code / configuration / script. 

# Get Jeka

* Snapshots : https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/dev/jeka/jeka-core/
* Releases : https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/dev/jeka/jeka-core/

The distribution is the file named jeka-core-x.x.x-distrib.zip. 

# How to use Jeka

Jeka is designed to be easy to master for Java developers. It is easy to figure out how it works by knowing few 
concepts and navigate in source code.

That said, documentation is needed for a starting point.

# How to build Jeka

Jeka is made of following projects :
* dev.jeka.core : complete Jeka project
* dev.jeka.samples : A sample project with several build classes to illustrate how Jeka can be used in different ways
* dev.jeka.depender-samples : A sample project depending on the above sample project to illustrate multi-project builds. 
These sample projects are also used to run some black-box tests

Jeka builds itself. To build Jeka full distrib from sources, the simpler is to use your IDE.

Once distrib created, add the distrib folder to your PATH environment variable.

## Build Jeka from Eclipse

* Clone this repository in Eclipse. Project is already configured ( *.project* and *.classpath* are stored in git). 
* Make sure the project is configured to compile using a JDK8 and not a JRE.
* Run `dev.jeka.core.CoreBuild` class main method. This class is located in *jeka/def* folder. 
* This creates the full distrib in *dev.jeka.core/jeka/output/distrib* folder

## Build Jeka from IntelliJ

* Clone this repository into IntelliJ. Project is already configured (.iml and modules.xml are stored in git).
* Make sure the project is configured with a JDK8.
* Run `dev.jeka.core.CoreBuild` class main method. This class is located in *jeka/def* folder, inside *dev.jeka.core* project.
* This creates the full distrib in *dev.jeka.core/jeka/output/distrib* folder
